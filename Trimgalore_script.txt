# the line above just says run this script with bash

# the options below are for the HPC queueing system
# the one you are most likely to need to change is run time h_rt
# this is set to 2 hours at the moment - the job is killed if it takes longer
# set it to the shortest time you can that is longer than the job will take
# if you set it to a very large value then your job will wait for ever on the queue to start
# OPTIONS FOR GRID ENGINE ==============================================================
#
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -l h_rt=2:00:00
#$ -l h_vmem=16G
#$ -pe smp 8
#$ -cwd
#$ -j y
#$ -V
# OPTIONS FOR GRID ENGINE=================================================================
# echo "Running on `hostname`"

# the commands below give a hint on how to run fastqc in this script
# you will need to look at the fastqc docs on the web to understand it
# the mkdir commands make directories (folders) for storing the results and for temporary workspace
# the command assumes the data file is in a folder called 'data'
# as you extend the script to do more things you might thing about using shell variables to make file
#       location and naming simpler, and loops over different data files
